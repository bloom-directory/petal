# {{petal-name}} operating contract

`/petals/{{petal-name}}/status.json` is a read-only health route with no side
effects.

## Development skill

Petals are authored against the `bloom-petal-development` skill. `petal new`
wrote it to `.agents/skills/bloom-petal-development/SKILL.md`, byte for byte
from the contract crate of the CLI that generated the scaffold, so it is
available offline and matches that CLI. Its directory carries the skill's
name, as the Agent Skills format requires. Load it into your agent before
extending this Petal. It is part of the Petal package, so editing or
refreshing it changes the package hash; Bloom does not serve it under
`/petals/{{petal-name}}/`.
